                <h2> Intro </h2>
                <p>It is widely agreed upon in the literature that automotive safety devices, particularly 
                seatbelts, are effective in saving lives in the event of an accident. However, whether 
                safety regulations are related to the rate at which crashes happen is less understood. 
                Some, such as Peltzman (1975), propose that there may be risk compensation effects related 
                to the use of seatbelts. Risk compensation theory postulates that as the perceived cost of 
                risk for some activity decreases, an individual's appetite for risk increases. Peltzman hypothesized 
                and found that seatbelts lowered drivers' perceived cost of risk and thus increased their 
                appetite for driving intensity.</p>

                <p>Peltzman's results have been highly scrutinized, with many, such as Robertson (1977), 
                and Cohen et al. (2001), claiming he used improper statistical techniques and proxy measures. 
                Even if Peltzman's conclusions were valid, I hypothesize that today, there are no risk compensation 
                effects associated with seatbelts; wearing a seatbelt is such commonplace behavior that it is 
                unlikely to affect driving habits. My research provides an up-to-date empirical analysis on the 
                life-saving potential of seatbelts conditional on being in an accident, as well as an investigation 
                into the existence of any risk compensation effects pertaining to seatbelt usage. To investigate 
                seatbelt effectiveness in the event of an accident, I control for other risky behaviors and 
                sex-based differences, revealing significant heterogeneous effects amongst men and women. 
                My general conclusions support the consensus in the literature that seatbelts are an effective 
                life-saving tool in the event of an accident and show that risky behaviors, such as the use of 
                illicit substances and speeding, are associated with increased odds of death. My results fail to 
                make any definitive conclusions on risk compensation as it pertains to safety devices but illuminate
                areas where further research may improve to uncover any such effects.</p>

                <p>This study has covered several critical aspects of automobile safety, particularly the efficacy of seatbelts in saving 
                    lives and the complex relationships between risky behavior and accident severity. The evidence 
                    found supports the life-saving potential of seatbelts, conditional on being in an accident, 
                    showing a substantial decrease in the probability of death for belted individuals in severe 
                    accidents. This aligns with the consensus in the safety literature and confirms the importance 
                    of seatbelt use as a critical safety measure. Furthermore, this research also sheds light on 
                    the differential impact of seatbelts across sexes, finding that women experience a greater 
                    relative reduction in the probability of fatality than men when wearing belts. The heterogeneous 
                    findings across sexes challenge existing work within the literature and prompt the need for a 
                    reevaluation of sex-based differences in the efficacy of safety mechanisms.</p>
                <p>The associations between alcohol and drug use and the severity of accidents are significant 
                    and reinforce previous common conceptions about the perilous outcomes stemming from driving 
                    under the influence. While this paper does not suggest a causal relationship, the significant 
                    correlation between substance use and increased probability of death in severe accidents should 
                    not be ignored.</p>
                <p>While I find significant interpretable results as it pertains to the efficacy of automotive 
                    safety conditional on being in an accident, the findings on the influences of seatbelt usage,
                     household income, and alcohol consumption on the frequency of accidents do not yield 
                     interpretable results. The small sample size and difficult-to-interpret proxy measures make 
                     for a statistically invalid model. While the results are non-significant, the study still 
                     raises questions about the potential existence of risk-compensating behaviors, promoting the 
                     need for further investigation with more sophisticated data methodology over a broader set of 
                     observations.</p>
                <p>The insights gained from my work demonstrate robustness in some areas but also show limitations
                     due to data constraints and potential biases. Thus, this examination should be used as a 
                     precursor for more detailed and sophisticated efforts into the complex network of variables 
                     that are associated with the incidence and severity of automotive accidents. Further research 
                     would do well to create a dataset that contains not only positive classification examples for 
                     when a driver does get into an accident but also negative examples for when a driver does not 
                     get into an accident. This would allow for discernment in the kind of behavioral 
                     characteristics that differ between those getting into a crash and those who do not. 
                     Additionally, a dataset where not all crashes involve a fatality may lead to a more relevant 
                     and broader set of applicable conclusions about what happens in all crashes rather than just 
                     those that are severe. Through such observations, a more comprehensive analysis can be 
                     undertaken to develop more effective safety regulations to reduce the on-road death toll</p>
