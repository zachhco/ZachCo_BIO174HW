# Homework 1:

Create a web page about some scientific theme that you are interested in. Make sure to use a separate CSS file to format
the page. Your page should have figures with legends, tables and you can even add a video if you want.

In this case Iâ€™m more interested in the formatting and aesthetics of the page than in the content, but please make sure
the content is also ok.

The other important aspect of this homework is for us to troubleshoot the process of submitting your homework to GitHub.
Make sure to create a folder named Homework 1 in your repository, to commit the changes and to sync your local and web 
repository.

The Homework 1 folder should contain your HTML page, the CSS page and any media that is necessary to load the page, and
no extra, superfluous files.

MAKE SURE THAT YOUR HTML IS SYNTATICALLY CORRECT. All tags should have their corresponding closing tags in the correct order.
